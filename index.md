this app is intended to become a simulation/emulation of the original version of Alexey Pajitnov's
Tetris, with all the quirks, bugs, and aesthetic qualities provided by the 1984 Elektronica-60 computer it was run on.

current development focus: 
  -emulating the display qualities of a cathode ray tube monitor, such as image distiortion, scanlines, and chromatic abberation
  -exploring possible audio assets.
